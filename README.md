## 📄 About This Repository

This is the official repository for the paper:

"Real-to-Sim for Highly Cluttered Environments via Physics-Consistent Inter-Object Reasoning"


The project focuses on reconstructing **dynamically consistent 3D scenes** from a single RGB-D observation by explicitly modeling inter-object contact and physical constraints, enabling reliable simulation and contact-rich robotic interaction.

## 🚧 Status: Code Release in Preparation  

This repository is currently under active development.
